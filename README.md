# RCBUS-TMS9918A-Dev
## Utilities and Code for the TMS9918A Video Card for RCBUS (RC2014 Compatible)

A small collection of CP/M utilities and suggested Code modifications to RomWBW HBIOS drivers for the TMS9918A Video Card (RCBUS architecture)
This will hopefully grow in the future to use the card for other things than playing Colecovision games ;-)

Code tested and used with Steve Cousins' SC-126 Z180 Computer Kit and J.B. Langston's TMS9918A Video Card, running ROMWBW*
